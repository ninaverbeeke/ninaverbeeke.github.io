Companies increasingly leverage data analytics to uncover insights into their customers' needs, preferences, and socio-demographic profiles. This information is essential for enhancing user experiences, differentiating from competitors, and creating products that satisfy market demands. Businesses are increasingly turning to more innovative approaches. One such approach is the analysis of customer-generated content, such as product reviews. Product reviews offer valuable insights into customer preferences and sentiments. Traditionally, product reviews have been analyzed primarily on feedback about the product, such as customer opinions, satisfaction levels, and sentiments on specific features. However, insights into customers' personal attributes, behaviors, and usage contexts have not been thoroughly explored. Addressing this gap presents a valuable opportunity to leverage user-generated content for a deeper understanding of customers. ")]),t("h4",[e._v(" Personal attributes extraction ")]),t("p",[e._v(" The extraction of personal attributes from product reviews is the focus of this research. Personal attributes are specific characteristics that uniquely describe an individual's traits, lifestyle, and circumstances, such as physical appearance, profession, household composition, and living situation. These attributes could include details such as hair type, skin condition, profession, number of family members or pets, and whether they live in an apartment, townhouse or single-family home. By extracting personal attributes from product reviews, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of customers. ")]),t("h4",[e._v("Approach")]),t("p",[e._v(" In line with previous research on extracting personal attributes, this study will also use the triplet format to store these attributes. However, our approach diverges by addressing some of the key limitations of earlier studies, including that previous research often relied on predefined lists of attributes. Inspired by recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs), this work introduces a novel approach for extracting personal attributes using these models. Our method aims to extract triplets from product reviews without being limited by predefined attribute categories, thus offering a more comprehensive and adaptable solution to capture the various personal attributes revealed in customer feedback.
