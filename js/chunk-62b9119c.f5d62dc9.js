Chances are you aren't springing out of bed and applauding the a.m. hours, at least not until you've tapped the snooze button a few too many times and then find yourself rushing to work or school. I decided to make a solution for this daily problem. My solution is the “Alarm Clock Mat”. It is a soft, grey-colored mat. You can set your alarm on a website and also decide which frequency of the alarm tone you want (high, middle or low). When the alarm goes off, you need to get out of bed and stand on the mat. The mat has sensors; once it senses that you are standing on the mat, the alarm will stop. The advantage is that you are immediately out of bed. To make the Alarm Clock Mat, I used an Arduino UNO RW that needs to be connected to a computer.
