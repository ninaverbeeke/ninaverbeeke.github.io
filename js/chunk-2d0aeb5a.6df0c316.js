Smart mirrors perfectly fit in a world where screens and data are everywhere, ready to feed you whatever information you need at a moment’s notice. We believe that a smart mirror is useful for any type of user. For example, when you look in the mirror at the start of the day it would be nice if the mirror has the ability to display information on it. A smart mirror can be used to display e.g. weather forecasts, a calendar schedule, a Twitter feed and much more. In this way, people can get informed while brushing their teeth or washing their face. The primary motivation behind the development of a smart mirror is to improve quality of life. The mirror provides an easy and convenient way to stay up-to-date and it allows people to multitask. Since smart mirrors are already developed, new requirements will be added to our application. The most important unique feature of Hermes is that it will use Google login to access Google calendar and Google Task lists. Another unique feature of our application is that users will be able to connect to the mirror through an Android application in order to set up their profile and presets. The smart mirror will essentially have two interfaces. The first one is an Android app through which the user can control the smart mirror. The initial setup of the smart mirror will require first pairing the mirror with the Android device through a bluetooth connection. Upon successful pairing, the user can select a Wi-Fi network to connect the smart mirror to. The main purpose of the app, outside of the initial setup, is for adding users and setting user presets. The second user interface will be the mirror itself. Although there will not be a touch screen or mouse/keyboard, the user will be able to change the data shown from the users’ preset default view through voice commands.
